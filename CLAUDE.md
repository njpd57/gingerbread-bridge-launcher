# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A recreation of the Android 2.3 **Gingerbread** home screen launcher, built as a web project for [Bridge Launcher](https://github.com/bridgelauncher/launcher). Bridge is an Android app that shows a WebView as the home screen and exposes Android features to it through `window.Bridge`. It started as a fork of Bridge's `api-tester` example and now lives in its own repo (`github.com/njpd57/gingerbread-bridge-launcher`). There is no native Android code here.

`FEATURES.md` is the roadmap: every idea with the Bridge API calls it needs, marked ✅ when done and ◐ when partly done. `README.md` is the user-facing documentation (in Spanish), including the optional permissions.

Stack: Vue 3 (`<script setup>`), TypeScript, Pinia setup stores, VueUse, SCSS, Vite 4 and Vitest. **User-facing text is in Spanish**; code and comments are in English.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Vite dev server; a BridgeMock stands in for window.Bridge (see below)
npm run build        # type-check (vue-tsc) + vite build -> dist/
npm run type-check   # vue-tsc only
npm run test:unit    # vitest in watch mode (jsdom)
npx vitest run       # all tests once
npx vitest run --dir src   # only this repo's tests (git worktrees under .claude/ would otherwise be picked up too)
npx vitest run src/stores/__tests__/useHomeLayoutStore.spec.ts -t "folders"   # a single file / test
npm run deploy [remote_dir]   # build and adb-push dist/ to the phone (scripts/deploy.sh)
npm run grant-permissions     # adb: grant Bridge WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS (needed to change the system night mode)
```

To run the launcher on a device, point Bridge's "project dir" setting at a folder containing the contents of `dist/`. The Vite build uses stable, unhashed asset names (`assets/index.js`), so copying a new `dist/` over the old one is enough.

Development happens on the **`dev`** branch. Keep `.claude/` (other agents' worktrees) out of commits.

## Bridge runtime

- `Bridge` is a global that only exists inside Bridge. In development, `src/mock/injectBridgeMockInDev.ts` installs `BridgeMock` from `@bridgelauncher/api-mock`. That mock reads its app list and icons from `public/mock/`, and calls such as `requestLaunchApp` show an `alert`. Types come from `@bridgelauncher/api` (v0.1.0, the latest). `Bridge` is also a Vue global property, so templates can call `Bridge.*` directly.
- **The installed Bridge can lack methods that the API types declare.** Bridge 0.1.0alpha has no `getCanRequestSystemNightMode`, and calling a missing method throws; when that happens while a store is being created, the whole launcher fails to load. Guard any method the launcher didn't already use successfully on the device with `bridgeHas()` from `src/utils/bridge-utils.ts`.
- **Permissions granted outside Bridge don't fire events.** `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` (night mode) is granted over adb, and lock screen needs Bridge's accessibility service; `useTogglesStore` re-reads the permission state on `afterResume`. The user-facing steps are in the README's "Permisos opcionales" section.
- **There is a single `window.onBridgeEvent` handler, and `useBridgeEventStore` owns it.** Everything else subscribes with `bridgeEvents.addEventListener(...)`. Never assign `window.onBridgeEvent` anywhere else.
- **The API can't do these things; don't design features that need them:**
  - Receive back-button events. The drawer uses a `history.pushState` workaround instead.
  - Read notifications or media sessions, or tell the default apps: only our fork can (below).
  - Embed native app widgets. All widgets are HTML.
  - Open intents other than launching an app by package name or opening a URL (the latter needs our fork, below).
- **Our Bridge fork ([njpd57/bridge-launcher](https://github.com/njpd57/bridge-launcher)) adds methods** that the published types lack. They are declared by module augmentation in `src/types/bridge-fork.d.ts`, and the dev mock implements them (`ForkBridgeMock` in `src/mock/injectBridgeMockInDev.ts`), so add new fork methods to both. Always call them behind `bridgeHas()` with a fallback for stock Bridge:
  - `requestSetScreenOrientation` / `getScreenOrientation`: `main.ts` locks the home screen to portrait at startup.
  - `getDefaultAppPackageName(role)`: `Dock.vue` uses it for the phone and browser buttons, falling back to a list of known package names.
  - `requestOpenUrl(url)`: the search panel offers a web search (Google), also on Enter when the query doesn't match exactly one app.
  - Notifications (`getCanReadNotifications`, `getNotificationsURL`, `getNotificationIconURL`, events `notificationPosted` / `notificationRemoved` / `canReadNotificationsChanged`): `useNotificationsStore` keeps the list; with access, the Gingerbread status bar shows real icons (`LiveNotificationIcons.vue`, one per app, filtered by `utils/notifications.ts`), otherwise the decorative ones. The access button is in the Appearance dialog.
  - **Our notification panel** (`src/notifications/NotificationPanel.vue`, state in `useMenuStore.isNotificationPanelOpen`, closed by back/home like the search panel): tapping the Gingerbread status bar or the power widget's notifications button opens it instead of Android's shade when the fork is present. It lists notifications in "En curso" / "Notificaciones" (`notificationPanelSections()`), opens them with `requestOpenNotification` and clears them with `requestDismissNotification`. On top, `QuickToggles.vue` (`useQuickSettingsStore`): flashlight, brightness (cycle auto/low/mid/high, `utils/brightness.ts`), auto-rotate and sync change directly; brightness and auto-rotate need the "Modify system settings" permission; Wi-Fi and Bluetooth only open Android's panel (`requestOpenSystemPanel`), since apps can't toggle them, but show whether they're on (`useQuickSettingsStore.wifiOn` / `bluetoothOn` / `locationOn`); the panel also has a GPS button.
  - **The power control widget** (`widgets/power/PowerControlWidget.vue`) shows the original 2.3 set with the fork (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, sync, brightness) and lock / night mode / notifications / settings with stock Bridge. With the fork, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS show whether they're on (`useQuickSettingsStore.wifiOn` / `bluetoothOn` / `locationOn`) though they can only open Android's panels. Its icons are in `src/home/icons/`, and the indicator bars come from `utils/indicators.ts`; lock screen and night mode are `useTogglesStore.lockScreen()` / `toggleNightMode()`, reached with the fork by long-pressing sync / brightness (those buttons stop `pointerdown` so HomeGrid's long press doesn't drag the widget).
  - **Calendar** (`getCanReadCalendar`, `requestCalendarPermission`, `getCalendarEventsURL(from, to)`, `requestOpenCalendarEvent`, `requestOpenCalendarAt`, events `canReadCalendarChanged` / `calendarChanged`; needs READ_CALENDAR, asked from the widget): `useCalendarStore` tracks access and bumps `version` so widgets refetch. The 4x2 `widgets/agenda/AgendaWidget.vue` lists the next 14 days' events grouped by day (`utils/calendar-events.ts`); the month calendar shows colored dots on days with events and opens the calendar app on a tapped day.
  - **Music** (`getMediaSession`, `getMediaArtURL`, `requestMediaAction`, `requestOpenMediaApp`, event `mediaSessionChanged`; needs notification access): `useMediaStore` holds the current session; `widgets/music/MusicPlayer.vue` shows it both as the 4x1 "Música" widget and at the top of the notification panel. `widgets/music/SongbirdPlayer.vue` is an alternative 4x1 widget in the style of Songbird's (art in a light frame, "Artist - Title" over three big glossy buttons). While the player shows, the panel hides media players' own notifications (`isMedia`). The position is extrapolated while playing (`utils/media.ts`).
  - Also from the fork, documented further down: `<input type="file">` opens Android's picker (the photo frame widget), the real signal / Wi-Fi / data activity in the Gingerbread status bar (`getConnectivity`), and app shortcuts on long press.
  - The fork's source is cloned at `~/Proyectos/bridge-launcher` (branch `main`); its own CLAUDE.md lists every method it adds. A fork method is added in Kotlin there first, then declared here in `bridge-fork.d.ts` and `ForkBridgeMock`.
  - Events the fork adds are typed as `BridgeForkEvent`; `useBridgeEventStore` hands listeners `AnyBridgeEvent`, so type listeners as `AnyBridgeEventListener`.
- **Bridge swaps top and left in every window inset** (getters and events): `WindowInsetsSnapshot` is declared `(top, left, right, bottom)` but `getSnapshot()` fills it positionally as `(left, top, right, bottom)`. On the Z Flip5 in portrait the camera cutout and `statusBarsIgnoringVisibility` (33 px, at the top) arrive as `left: 33, top: 0`. It's in upstream Bridge too; the fix belongs in the fork (named arguments). Until then, a Bridge `top` can't be trusted on its own, so keep the existing fallbacks (`env(safe-area-inset-top)`, the minimum, the manual height). `FEATURES.md` ("Fallos de Bridge") tracks both insets bugs.
- **Diagnostics:** Appearance → "Acerca de y diagnóstico" (`menu/AboutDialog.vue`) shows the build (`__BUILD_INFO__` from `vite.config.ts`: commit, uncommitted changes, date), Bridge/Android versions, live insets, permissions, the last API error and the last 30 Bridge events (`useBridgeEventStore.recentEvents()`, a fixed-size `RingLog` that stores events as they come and only summarizes them when the dialog reads them). Check it first when something looks off on the phone. For deeper debugging, and **only when the user allows it** (they do device testing themselves), the WebView is debuggable over adb: `adb forward tcp:9333 localabstract:webview_devtools_remote_<pid>` and use the DevTools protocol.
- **Bridge's window-insets events don't match the API types.** Bridge sends `{ name: 'ImeWindowInsetsChanged', insets }` (name from its Kotlin enum, value in `insets`), not `{ name: 'imeWindowInsetsChanged', newValue }`; `parseInsetsEvent()` in `useWindowInsetsStore` accepts both. Before that, inset events were ignored, and a keyboard inset read while the keyboard was open stayed stale, leaving dialogs cut short.
- **`statusBars` insets are 0 while the status bar is hidden, which is expected** (they measure the visible bar); the size the bar would have is in the `IgnoringVisibility` variants. But even the `IgnoringVisibility` top is 0 on the device, because of the top/left swap above: the 33 px arrive as `left`. `useWindowInsetsStore` resolves the bar heights: it re-reads the insets after startup and on resume, falls back to other insets, then to `env(safe-area-inset-*)` (`index.html` sets `viewport-fit=cover`), then to a minimum. The user can also set a manual status bar height. **For layout, use the CSS variables `--status-bar-height` and `--nav-bar-height`, which are set on `.launcher-root`, not the raw insets.** App icons likewise use `--icon-size` (home screen, folders, drag; capped to the cell by `fittedIconSize()` in `utils/iconSize.ts`) and `--drawer-icon-size`, both from `settings.iconScale`.

## Architecture

`App.vue` stacks absolutely positioned layers, bottom to top:
1. The live wallpaper (a canvas: Nexus, Grass, Galaxy, Magic Smoke or Polar Clock, mapped in `wallpaper/liveWallpapers.ts`; those that react to taps expose `tap(x, y)`), or nothing when the system wallpaper is selected. They share `wallpaper/useLiveWallpaper.ts`: sizing, parallax (a world 1.5 screens wide), the frame loop at `settings.nexusFps` and pausing.
2. `Workspace`: `PAGE_COUNT` (5) horizontally scroll-snapped pages, starting on `DEFAULT_PAGE` (2), each rendering a `HomeGrid`.
3. `Dock`.
4. `AppDrawer`.
5. `FolderPanel`.
6. `DragLayer`.
7. The options menu, the dialogs and the search panel.
8. The status bar: either `statusbar/GingerbreadStatusBar.vue` (our own bar) or a background strip behind the system one.

State lives in Pinia stores under `src/stores/`. Persistent state uses VueUse `useLocalStorage`: `home.items`, `home.gridRows`, `home.autoRows`, `launcher.recentApps`, `launcher.launchCounts`, `settings.*` and `weather.*`.

Widgets live in `src/widgets/<name>/`; `widgets/WidgetView.vue` maps each `WidgetKind` to its component. `WidgetView` also receives the home item id (`widgetId`) for widgets with per-instance data: the photo frame keeps each frame's photo in IndexedDB under that id (`widgets/photo/photo-storage.ts`) and prunes photos of removed frames when a frame mounts. Smaller per-instance data (countdown, note, timer, tasks, feed URL) goes through `useWidgetData(widgetId, empty, preview)` (`stores/useWidgetDataStore.ts`): kept in localStorage under `widgets.data`, dropped when the widget is removed, and returning the `preview` sample without writing when there's no `widgetId` (the "Añadir" previews). **Widget settings and text entry use `components/WidgetDialog.vue`**, a `GbDialog` teleported to `.launcher-root` so it isn't clipped by the cell and recenters above the keyboard. The forecast and sun/moon widgets read the 6-day `days` that `useWeatherStore` fetches along with the current weather.

- **The home screen model is `useHomeLayoutStore`.** It holds a flat list of items (`app` | `widget` | `folder`), each with `page, x, y, w, h`.
  - The grid has `GRID_COLS` (4) columns and a **variable** number of rows. `autoGridRows()` picks the row count from the screen size (Gingerbread's cell proportions, 4–7 rows), and the user can override it.
  - When the row count shrinks, `fitItemsToGrid()` moves items that no longer fit. That move is permanent, so `App.vue` only measures the automatic rows in **portrait**: rotating to landscape keeps the portrait rows (persisted as `home.autoRows`) instead of shrinking the grid. `main.ts` also tries `screen.orientation.lock('portrait')`, which the WebView will probably reject.
  - Widget sizes are defined in `WIDGET_SIZES`. **Adding a widget kind touches three places:** `WidgetKind`/`WIDGET_SIZES`, the render branch in `widgets/WidgetView.vue` (used by `HomeGrid`, `DragLayer` and the live previews in `AddDialog`), and the list in `AddDialog.vue`. The previews render every widget at its home screen size (`useHomeGridSize()`) scaled down, so a widget must work without a `widgetId` and without side effects beyond reading its store.
- **Drag and drop runs through `useDragStore`.**
  - Each `HomeGrid` registers its element per page, and the `Dock` registers the trash zone, which replaces the hotseat while a drag is active. Drop targets are computed from those elements' on-screen rectangles.
  - A drag payload comes from one of three sources: `drawer`, `home` or `folder`. `applyDrop()` handles every combination of source and target (cell, folder or trash).
  - While a drag is active, the store listens to pointer events on `window` and cancels `touchmove` (non-passive) so the WebView doesn't scroll under the finger.
  - Click handlers call `drag.justDropped()` to ignore the click that follows a drop.
- **Launch apps through `useAppLauncherStore().launch()`**, never `Bridge.requestLaunchApp` directly: it records recent apps (shown by the search panel when its field is empty) and launch counts (the "Apps más usadas" widget, ranked by `utils/mostUsed.ts`).
- **The search widget** opens `widgets/search/SearchPanel.vue` via `menu.showSearch()`; matching lives in `utils/search.ts` (accent- and case-insensitive, ranked). The panel pads itself above the keyboard with `useKeyboardInset()`, which combines Bridge's IME inset with how much the WebView already shrank. `GbDialog` and the folder panel use it too, so **text entry belongs in a `GbDialog`**, not in a widget on the grid (the keyboard can cover a low widget; see the weather widget's city dialog). `App.vue` doesn't re-measure the automatic rows while an input has focus, so a keyboard that shrinks the WebView can't move icons.
- **App shortcuts (Bridge fork: `getAppShortcutsURL`, `getAppShortcutIconURL`, `requestStartAppShortcut`; only the default launcher can read them).** Long-pressing an app on the home screen or in the drawer both starts a drag and opens `shortcuts/AppShortcutsMenu.vue` (`useAppShortcutsStore`) next to the icon, with the app's shortcuts and "Información de la app". `useDragStore.hasMoved` tells them apart: moving the finger more than `DRAG_MOVE_PX` closes the menu and keeps dragging (the drawer only closes then); releasing in place cancels the drag and leaves the menu open. Folders don't show the menu yet.
- **Long press is the `useLongPress` composable.** One instance can serve a whole `v-for`. Click handlers must call `consumeLongPress()`, so the click that ends a long press is ignored.
- **`useMenuStore` is the single source of truth for overlays**: the options menu, the open dialog (`LauncherDialog`), the open folder and the search panel.
  - Long-pressing empty workspace opens the options menu. It records the pressed cell as `addAnchor`, which "Añadir" uses to place new items.
  - The Android home button (Bridge's `newIntent` event) is handled in `useWorkspaceStore`. It closes the first open thing in this order: menus (including the search panel), then the drawer; if nothing is open, it returns to the default page.
  - The drawer and the search panel push a history entry when they open, so the back button (which Bridge forwards to the WebView history) closes them. This works on the test device.
- **`useSettingsStore`** holds the launcher's preferences (wallpaper, status bar, overscroll glow, adding icons on install). Whenever it changes a Bridge setting for a feature (hiding the status bar, turning off Bridge's overscroll effect), it saves the previous value and restores it when the feature is turned off.
  - With `addIconOnInstall`, it listens for `appInstalled` and puts the new app's icon in the first free cell (`addAppAnywhere()`), starting on the default page.
  - `gingerbreadOverscroll` draws Gingerbread's orange glow at the ends of scroll containers (`useOverscrollGlow` + `OverscrollGlow.vue`, used by the drawer, the workspace, dialogs, folders and search).
  - Turning on `gingerbreadStatusBar` hides the system status bar through Bridge (remembering the previous appearance so it can be restored), and `App.vue` draws `statusbar/GingerbreadStatusBar.vue` instead.
  - That bar gets battery from web APIs (`useDeviceStatus`). With our fork, the network in use, the Wi-Fi and mobile signal levels and the data activity arrows are real (`getConnectivity` / `connectivityChanged` in `useConnectivityStore`, mapped by `utils/connectivity.ts`; Bridge measures the arrows from the device's traffic while the home screen is visible, because One UI doesn't report data activity to apps). On stock Bridge, `useSimulatedSignal` fakes a slowly drifting level (narrowed by the browser's `effectiveType` estimate when available) plus data activity arrows.
  - Choosing a wallpaper also switches Bridge's "draw system wallpaper behind WebView" setting (through `useTogglesStore`) to match.
  - With the system wallpaper, it also sends wallpaper scroll offsets.
- **The weather widget uses Open-Meteo** (geocoding and forecast, no API key). The city and the last result are cached in localStorage, and it refreshes when the data is stale and on resume.

## Conventions

- Brace style is Allman (the opening brace on its own line), with 4-space indentation, in both TS and Vue files.
- **Gingerbread look:**
  - The pressed state is orange (`#ffa800`, gradient `#ffc64d → #ff8a00`), both as a background and as an icon `drop-shadow` glow.
  - Dialogs, buttons and radio rows reuse `GbDialog`, `GbButton` and `GbRadioRow` from `src/components/`.
  - Icons are inline SVG Vue components, under `src/home/icons/` and in the widgets' folders.
  - **Widgets use the Songbird / power control look, never a flat translucent panel.** `vars.scss` has the mixins: `gb-widget-frame` (gray-to-black frame, light border, shadow) or `gb-widget-glossy` (the power control's glossy panel) for the outside; `gb-widget-bar` for a title bar; `gb-widget-inset` for a recessed list or display; `gb-widget-button` for big glossy gray buttons (group them in a `1px solid #111` bordered box with `#111` dividers); `gb-pressed` for the orange pressed state. The note (paper) and the calculator (its own keypad) are deliberate exceptions.
  - **Nothing that reads as modern Android/Material:** no circular avatars, round colored badges, pill buttons, flat chips or large radii. Shapes are square or barely rounded (2–7 px), with gradients, thin light borders and drop shadows. Contact photos use `gb-contact-photo` (Gingerbread's QuickContactBadge: square, thin light frame, gray silhouette as the default picture); shortcut overlays such as direct dial's are a bare green glyph in the corner, not a colored circle.
- `src/assets/styles/shared/vars.scss` (durations and easings such as `$ease-mat-decel`, and the widget mixins above) is auto-injected into every SCSS block by `vite.config.ts`.
- Fonts in `src/assets/fonts/` come from AOSP android-2.3.7_r1 (Apache 2.0, see `NOTICE`): Droid Sans for everything and Clockopia for the digital clock.
- Tests cover pure logic: the layout model, inset parsing, `bridgeHas()`, app search, the month grid and the quote of the day. Keep new logic in pure functions so it can be tested the same way. DOM, canvas and drag behavior are verified in the browser or on the device.
